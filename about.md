I completed my Msc under supervision of Angelo Perkusich and Hyggo Almeira at Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG), researching at Embedded Lab. Since 2014, I am PhD student at the same university advised by Gustavo Soares and Rohit Gheyi on the Software Productivity Group (SPG). My research interest involves the study of techniques to improve developers productivity.
